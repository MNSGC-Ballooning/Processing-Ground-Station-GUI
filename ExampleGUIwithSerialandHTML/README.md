1. Download GroundStationApp folder
2. Unzip to any location
3. open the folder and click on the .exe file.
***If you want to interact with the app using sample data via an arduino, read on.***
5. Download ExampleSerialData folder
6. Unzip to your arduino sketches folder
7. Plug in an arduino uno and upload the code from ExampleSerialData to the arduino (REMEMBER THE COM PORT WHERE THE ARDUINO IS PLUGGED IN)
8. Go back to the ground station application and select the COM port where the arduino is plugged in.
